# Brilliant agile project management
<h3>A practical guide to using Agile, Scrum and Kanban by Rob Cole and Edward Scotcher</h3>

## Manifesto for Agile Software Development
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it
and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

    Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    Working software over comprehensive documentation
    Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    Responding to change over following a plan
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the
items on the left more.

## Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto
We follow these principles:

    ✔ ✔ Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
    continuous delivery of valuable software.
    ✔ ✔ Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile
    processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
    ✔ ✔ Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a
    couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
    ✔ ✔ Business people and developers must work together daily
    throughout the project.
    ✔ ✔ Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the
    environment and support they need, and trust them to get the
    job done.
    ✔ ✔ The most efficient and effective method of conveying
    information to and within a development team is face-to-face
    conversation.
    ✔ ✔ Working software is the primary measure of progress.
    ✔ ✔ Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors,
    developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant
    pace indefinitely.
    ✔ ✔ Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
    enhances agility.
    ✔ Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done
    is essential.
    ✔ ✔ The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from
    self-organizing teams.
    ✔ ✔ At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become
    more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly
    
    
## The Declaration of Interdependence   
Agile and adaptive approaches for linking people, projects and
value.
We are a community of project leaders that are highly successful at
delivering results. To achieve these results:

✔ ✔ We increase return on investment by making continuous flow
of value our focus.
✔ ✔ We deliver reliable results by engaging customers in frequent
interactions and shared ownership.
✔ ✔ We expect uncertainty and manage for it through iterations,
anticipation, and adaptation.
✔ We unleash creativity and innovation by recognizing that
individuals are the ultimate source of value, and creating an
environment where they can make a difference.
✔ ✔ We boost performance through group accountability for results
and shared responsibility for team effectiveness.
✔ ✔ We improve effectiveness and reliability through situationally
specific strategies, processes and practices.

## The core messages are simple, powerful and extremely appealing:

✔ ●We increase return on investment.
✔ ● We deliver reliable results.
✔ ● We expect uncertainty.
✔ ● We unleash creativity and innovation.
✔ ● We boost performance.
✔ ● We improve effectiveness and reliability.

## Project Management Triangle.
Traditional project management thinking has always
acknowledged the importance of time, cost and scope and together
they’re known in the game as the Project Management Triangle.

Because of this rigid relationship, one side of the triangle cannot
be changed without affecting the others. There are always
consequences if the scope, time or cost parameters are adjusted.
This happens frequently with projects when new requirements
are added, timescales are reined in or budgets are slashed.
Of course it never happens the other way round! Over the
years project teams have battled with trying to keep the three
constraints balanced, invariably a case of Mission Impossible.

## Keep in mind
Customers don’t want better project management. They want better
product delivery. All the agile tools and techniques exist solely to
that end. Use whatever techniques get the best results but don’t
get hung up on the methods themselves. The ends are much more
important than the means.

# AGILE MANIFESTO
<h3>Agile stands on three manifetos</h3>

* Individuals and Interactions over process and tools
* Working softwares over comprehensive documentations
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiations
* Responding to change over following a plan
# AGILE PRINCIPLE

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile
processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a
couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* Business people and developers must work together daily
throughout the project
