* WF is a sequential & linear process of PM
* The previous step must be finished before we go to the next one (just like a water fall, starting at the top of the mountain, and falls subsequently)

## AGILE 
* Being able to move quickly & easily
* Flexibility and Willingness and ability to adapt the change
