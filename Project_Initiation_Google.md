### Performing a cost-benefit analysis
### The benefits of a cost-benefit analysis
A cost-benefit analysis can minimize risks and maximize gains for projects and organizations. It can help you communicate clearly with stakeholders and executives and keep your project on track. Because this type of analysis uses objective data, it can help reduce biases and keep stakeholder self-interest from influencing decisions. 

Comparing a project’s benefits to its costs can help you make a strong business case to stakeholders and leadership and ensure your organization pursues the most profitable or useful projects. Organizations use cost-benefit analyses to reduce waste and invest their resources responsibly.
### Guiding questions for a cost-benefit analysis
When you’re pursuing a project, the benefits should outweigh the costs. It’s important for you and your stakeholders to consider questions like the ones that follow early on, while you prepare the proposal.

To determine the benefits of a project, you might ask:

    What value will this project create? 
    How much money could this project save our organization? 
    How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
    How much time will it save? 
    How will it improve the customer experience?

And to determine the costs of a project, consider questions such as:

    How much time will people have to spend on this project?
    What are the one-time costs?
    Are there any ongoing costs?
    What about long-term costs? 

You might also consider questions about intangible benefits. These are gains that are not quantifiable, such as:

    Customer satisfaction. Will the project increase customer retention, causing them to spend more on the company’s products or services? 
    Employee satisfaction. Is the project likely to improve employee morale, reducing turnover? 
    Employee productivity. Will the project reduce employee’s overtime hours, saving the company money?
    Brand perception. Is the project likely to improve the company’s brand perception and recognition, attracting more customers or providing a competitive advantage?
    
You can also flip these questions to consider intangible costs. These are costs that are not quantifiable. For example, might the project put customer retention, employee satisfaction, or brand perception at risk?

When assigning values to tangible or intangible costs and benefits, you can reference similar past projects, conduct industry research, or consult with experts.
### Calculating costs and benefits

The process of calculating costs and benefits is also called calculating return on investment, or ROI. There are many ways to determine a project’s ROI, but the easiest way is to compare the upfront and ongoing costs to its benefits over time.

One common ROI formula is:
<img src = 'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61450446/124401176-1f63da00-dd28-11eb-8518-0a0b1a8c5149.png' width = '600'>

In this formula, G represents the financial gains you expect from the project, and C represents the upfront and ongoing costs of your investment in the project.

For example, imagine your project costs $6,000 up front plus $25 per month for 12 months. This equals $300 per year, but you estimate that the project will bring in $10,000 in revenue over the course of that year. Using the formula above, you calculate the ROI as: ($10,000 - $6,300) ÷ $6,300 = 0.58 = 58%

The ROI comes to 0.58, or 58%. You consider this to be a strong ROI, so you decide to pursue the project.

### Key takeaway

Performing a cost-benefit analysis can help you and your stakeholders determine if it makes sense to take on a new project by evaluating if its benefits outweigh its costs. When conducting cost-benefit analyses for your prospective projects, you can use the guiding questions and ROI formula provided in this reading as a reference.

### Determining project goals and deliverables
1. Goals: 

        The desired outcome of the project, 
        what your are tryin to do and what you are trying to achieve. 
        You must know when you arrive your goal. 
        When you are starting a project review your goal well and kanke sure to define them perfectly.
        To do this you might need more information from your stakeholders

2. Deliverable: 

        A tangible outcome of the project. 
        What gets produced at the end of a task, event, or process
        Helps quantify and realize the impact of the project

### How to set SMART goals

                S: Specific
                M: Measurable
                A: Attainable
                A: Attainable
                R: Relavent


    S: Specific
        - What do I want to accomplish?
        - Why is this a goal?
        - Who is involved?
        - Where should the goal to be delivred- the recipient?
        - To what degree- requirements and constraints?
    M: Measurable
    Can be get an answer by asking-  
        How much?
        How many?
        How will I know when it's accomplished?
    - Means they are objecttively met
    - A way to track the progress and keep people motivated
    - To track measure you can use metrics and benchmarks
    
 
    A: Attainable
        Can it be reasonably reached?
        How can it be accomplished?
    
    R: Relavent
    - Does it make sense try and achieve this goal? 
        How this goal lines up with otheer goals, priorties, and values
    - If the goal is worthwhile?
        Does balance outweigh the benefits?
        Does it meet the organizatiosn other needs and pririties?
        Everyone using the product should feet that the goal is worth supporting
    - Is it right time?
        Can the project duration and the surrounding social context m ake an impact? 
        
    
    T:Time-bound
    - Has a clear deadline or time frame

### SMART goals: Making goals meaningful
Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) goals are very helpful for ensuring project success. As you start your career in project management, you may not directly set the project goals, but you should be able to clarify and understand them. SMART goals help you see the full scope of a goal, determine its feasibility, and clearly define project success in concrete terms. 

Let’s recap what we discussed in the previous video by taking a look at a breakdown of the criteria for SMART goals below: 


<br><br> <img src = 'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61450446/124449516-d3df1980-dd83-11eb-91c8-de8959df5c1d.png' width = '900'> <br><br><br>

    Specific: The objective has no ambiguity for the project team to misinterpret. 
    Measurable: Metrics help the project team determine when the objective is met.
    Attainable: The project team agrees the objective is realistic.
    Relevant: The goal fits the organization’s strategic plan and supports the project charter.
    Time-bound: The project team documents a date to achieve the goal.
    
    You may see variations on what each letter in the “SMART” acronym stands for. (For example, you may see “actionable” or “achievable” instead of “attainable” or “realistic” instead of “relevant.”) However, the general intent of each of these terms—to make sure the goal is within reach—is always similar.
    
### Focusing on the "M" in SMART

Let’s take a moment to zoom in on the M in SMART, which stands for measurable. Having measurable goals allows you to assess the success of your project based on quantifiable or tangible metrics, such as dollar amounts, number of outputs, quantities, etc. Measurable goals are important because they leave little room for confusion around expectations from stakeholders. 

Not every metric will have value, so you will have to determine which metrics make sense for the project. For example, measuring how many meetings the software engineers on your project attend on a weekly basis may not be the most valuable metric for a productivity goal. Alternatively, you might measure other aspects of the engineers’ productivity, such as a particular number of features created per engineer or a specific number of issues flagged per day.    
    
### Defining a SMART goal

Let’s explore an example related to making a personal goal measurable. Imagine you are looking to make a career change, and you set a goal to complete a Google Career Certificate. You can measure the success of this goal because after completing the entire program, you will receive a certificate—a tangible outcome.

Now, let’s determine how to make the remaining elements of this goal SMART. In this example, your specific goal is to attain a Google Career Certificate. You can make this goal attainable by deciding that you will complete one course per month. This goal is relevant because it supports your desire to make a career change. Finally, you can make this goal time-bound by deciding that you will complete the program within six months.

After defining each of these components, your SMART goal then becomes: Obtain a Google Career Certificate by 

### Key takeaway

Determining metrics can be extremely helpful in capturing statuses, successes, delays, and more in a project. As a project manager, identifying meaningful metrics can help move the project toward its goal. Additionally, by defining each element of a project goal to make it SMART, you can determine what success means for that goal and how to achieve it.

### Determining a project's scope
 
     Simply put project and its boundary
     Scope makes sure that your project is clearly defined and mapped out, who is using the nd result, its complexicity
     Is it easily manageable in subtasks?
     Scope also define project timeline, budget and resources
     
     Additional questions with project scope
        * where did the projec come from?
        * why is it needed?
        * why is the project expected to achieve?
        * what does the project sponsor have in mind?
      

### Asking scope-defining questions
Imagine that while working in a restaurant management group, your manager calls and asks you to “update the dining space,” then quickly hangs up the phone without providing further instruction. In this initial handoff from the manager, you are missing a lot of information. How do you even know what to ask?

Let’s quickly recap the concept of scope. The scope provides the boundaries for your project. You define the scope to help identify necessary resources, resource costs, and a schedule for the project. 

In the situation we just described, here are some questions you might ask your manager in order to get the information you need to define the scope of the project:

### Monitoring and maintaining a project's scope
__In-scope & out-of-scope__

    In-scope: tasks that are included in the project plan and contribute to the project's goal
    Out-of-scope: tasks that are not included
    
    Scope creep: any changes, growth, idea, and uncontrolled factors that affect the project's scope at any point after the project begin.

### Measuring project success
In this lesson, you are learning to distinguish the difference between a project launch and a project landing. Let’s focus here on the difference between launches and landings and how to ensure that your project will be completed successfully.

You will often hear companies celebrating the launch of a new product, service, or initiative, and it is important to remember that even when your project is out in the world, your work isn’t complete. When working on a project, the goal isn’t simply to launch it, but to land it. Landings occur once your project achieves a measure of success. As project managers, landings are what we strive for and what we celebrate. They are the ultimate reward for all of our efforts. 

__Launching vs. landing a project__

In project management, a project “launching” means you have delivered the final results of the project to the client or user. You can’t solely base project success on when the client accepts the project, though. Your work on a project won’t be complete until you “land” it by thoroughly measuring the results. This is when the success criteria and the metrics you defined initially when setting SMART goals will come in handy.  

Teams should be clear on what they are trying to accomplish, beyond just launching something to users. Will your project increase retention? Will your project speed up a product feature? Depending on the product and situation, the answers will differ, but it is important that your team aligns and works toward the same measurable goal. 

__Launch first, land later__

Let’s consider an example: imagine you are a project manager for an eco-friendly organization. Your organization asks you to create a training program for middle school students in your county to teach them about the impacts of recycling. The county's goal is to increase recycling by 20% over the next five years. You gather your team and start developing the learning content to build out this training program. It takes you and your team one year to complete the research, development, and production of this training. When you hand over the training to the school district, you are launching the project. In order to know your project actually landed at the intended goal, you need to check back in periodically over the next five years to see if the training program is on target to produce a 20% increase in recycling in the county. 

__Launch and forget__

A common mistake of many project teams is to “launch and forget” the results. This happens when a project manager delivers the project to the client and the client accepts the project delivery, but the project manager doesn’t assess if the project deliverables satisfy the customer or user. In the example above, if you didn’t check back periodically over five years to assess the results, you would have only launched—but not landed—the project. Launching and landings work in tandem to ensure true success. 

A project landing shouldn’t create more hurdles. If done correctly, a landing creates greater alignment within the teams on the end results you all desire, and it gives everybody on the team better visibility on how to achieve success.

__Defining success criteria__
* How will we know the project is successful?

So go through your project goals and deliverables, review the scope, and
identify the measurable aspects of your project.
These are going to be any of the metrics used in the goals and
deliverables, along with your budget and schedule details.
Another thing you'll need to do is get clarity from stakeholders on the project
requirements and expectations.


__Product quality__

The product, or final result, of a project has its own set of attributes that define success. The product attributes that are necessary for the product’s success include completeness in features, quality of features, unit cost, usability, etc. The extent that a product is complete will contribute to the product’s success. This can apply to any project in which you deliver a product or tangible outcome at the end. To keep us on track for success, we can create a list of product requirements to ensure that you do not miss anything. For example, if the project produces word processing software, you need basic features like text entry, formatting, saving, and printing. Since you require each feature to have a functional word processor by today’s standards, you include these features on your checklist. 

To measure the success of a product, consider including these metrics on your checklist: 

    Track if you implemented the product’s priority requirements
    Track and assess the product’s number of technical issues or defects
    Measure the percentage of features you delivered or released at the end of the project

__What is important to the customers or stakeholders 

We have to pay attention to product metrics, but we also have to be mindful of stakeholder and customer additional expectations for features and objectives. In the word processor example, a stakeholder may want to add an additional functionality to easily create tables in a document with text. Additionally, a strategic goal of the organization could be to create word processor software with more collaborative ability than the word processors currently on the market. Each component is necessary in order to meet customer and stakeholder expectations. Think about what needs the project satisfies for your stakeholders or customers. These strategic goals tie back to the business case and the reason you initiated the project in the first place. Often, you can measure the fulfillment of strategic goals via user or customer metrics. Metrics to consider include:

    Evaluating user engagement with the product 
    Measuring stakeholder and customer satisfaction via surveys
    Tracking user adoption of the product by using sales data

__Document, align, and communicate success__

Understanding where we are and where we are going helps the project team determine if they are on track. As you learned in the video on this topic, you need to get clarity from stakeholders on the project requirements and expectations. There are many people involved with any project
and success will look different for each of them. You want to ask questions, such as: Who ultimately says whether or not the project is successful? What criteria will be measured to determine success? What is the success of this project based on? It is best practice to get the key stakeholders or the steering committee to review and approve your success criteria. This becomes a mutual agreement on how all parties define the success of the project.
