### Performing a cost-benefit analysis
### The benefits of a cost-benefit analysis
A cost-benefit analysis can minimize risks and maximize gains for projects and organizations. It can help you communicate clearly with stakeholders and executives and keep your project on track. Because this type of analysis uses objective data, it can help reduce biases and keep stakeholder self-interest from influencing decisions. 

Comparing a project’s benefits to its costs can help you make a strong business case to stakeholders and leadership and ensure your organization pursues the most profitable or useful projects. Organizations use cost-benefit analyses to reduce waste and invest their resources responsibly.
### Guiding questions for a cost-benefit analysis
When you’re pursuing a project, the benefits should outweigh the costs. It’s important for you and your stakeholders to consider questions like the ones that follow early on, while you prepare the proposal.

To determine the benefits of a project, you might ask:

    What value will this project create? 
    How much money could this project save our organization? 
    How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
    How much time will it save? 
    How will it improve the customer experience?

And to determine the costs of a project, consider questions such as:

    How much time will people have to spend on this project?
    What are the one-time costs?
    Are there any ongoing costs?
    What about long-term costs? 

You might also consider questions about intangible benefits. These are gains that are not quantifiable, such as:

    Customer satisfaction. Will the project increase customer retention, causing them to spend more on the company’s products or services? 
    Employee satisfaction. Is the project likely to improve employee morale, reducing turnover? 
    Employee productivity. Will the project reduce employee’s overtime hours, saving the company money?
    Brand perception. Is the project likely to improve the company’s brand perception and recognition, attracting more customers or providing a competitive advantage?
    
You can also flip these questions to consider intangible costs. These are costs that are not quantifiable. For example, might the project put customer retention, employee satisfaction, or brand perception at risk?

When assigning values to tangible or intangible costs and benefits, you can reference similar past projects, conduct industry research, or consult with experts.
### Calculating costs and benefits

The process of calculating costs and benefits is also called calculating return on investment, or ROI. There are many ways to determine a project’s ROI, but the easiest way is to compare the upfront and ongoing costs to its benefits over time.

One common ROI formula is:
<img src = 'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61450446/124401176-1f63da00-dd28-11eb-8518-0a0b1a8c5149.png' width = '600'>

In this formula, G represents the financial gains you expect from the project, and C represents the upfront and ongoing costs of your investment in the project.

For example, imagine your project costs $6,000 up front plus $25 per month for 12 months. This equals $300 per year, but you estimate that the project will bring in $10,000 in revenue over the course of that year. Using the formula above, you calculate the ROI as: ($10,000 - $6,300) ÷ $6,300 = 0.58 = 58%

The ROI comes to 0.58, or 58%. You consider this to be a strong ROI, so you decide to pursue the project.

### Key takeaway

Performing a cost-benefit analysis can help you and your stakeholders determine if it makes sense to take on a new project by evaluating if its benefits outweigh its costs. When conducting cost-benefit analyses for your prospective projects, you can use the guiding questions and ROI formula provided in this reading as a reference.

### Determining project goals and deliverables
1. Goals: 

        The desired outcome of the project, 
        what your are tryin to do and what you are trying to achieve. 
        You must know when you arrive your goal. 
        When you are starting a project review your goal well and kanke sure to define them perfectly.
        To do this you might need more information from your stakeholders

2. Deliverable: 

        A tangible outcome of the project. 
        What gets produced at the end of a task, event, or process
        Helps quantify and realize the impact of the project

### How to set SMART goals

                S: Specific
                M: Measurable
                A: Attainable
                A: Attainable
                R: Relavent


    S: Specific
        - What do I want to accomplish?
        - Why is this a goal?
        - Who is involved?
        - Where should the goal to be delivred- the recipient?
        - To what degree- requirements and constraints?
    M: Measurable
    Can be get an answer by asking-  
        How much?
        How many?
        How will I know when it's accomplished?
    - Means they are objecttively met
    - A way to track the progress and keep people motivated
    - To track measure you can use metrics and benchmarks
    
 
    A: Attainable
        Can it be reasonably reached?
        How can it be accomplished?
    
    R: Relavent
    - Does it make sense try and achieve this goal? 
        How this goal lines up with otheer goals, priorties, and values
    - If the goal is worthwhile?
        Does balance outweigh the benefits?
        Does it meet the organizatiosn other needs and pririties?
        Everyone using the product should feet that the goal is worth supporting
    - Is it right time?
        Can the project duration and the surrounding social context m ake an impact? 
        
    
    T:Time-bound
    - Has a clear deadline or time frame

### SMART goals: Making goals meaningful
Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) goals are very helpful for ensuring project success. As you start your career in project management, you may not directly set the project goals, but you should be able to clarify and understand them. SMART goals help you see the full scope of a goal, determine its feasibility, and clearly define project success in concrete terms. 

Let’s recap what we discussed in the previous video by taking a look at a breakdown of the criteria for SMART goals below: 


<br><br> <img src = 'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61450446/124449516-d3df1980-dd83-11eb-91c8-de8959df5c1d.png' width = '900'> <br><br><br>

    Specific: The objective has no ambiguity for the project team to misinterpret. 
    Measurable: Metrics help the project team determine when the objective is met.
    Attainable: The project team agrees the objective is realistic.
    Relevant: The goal fits the organization’s strategic plan and supports the project charter.
    Time-bound: The project team documents a date to achieve the goal.
    
    You may see variations on what each letter in the “SMART” acronym stands for. (For example, you may see “actionable” or “achievable” instead of “attainable” or “realistic” instead of “relevant.”) However, the general intent of each of these terms—to make sure the goal is within reach—is always similar.
    
### Focusing on the "M" in SMART

Let’s take a moment to zoom in on the M in SMART, which stands for measurable. Having measurable goals allows you to assess the success of your project based on quantifiable or tangible metrics, such as dollar amounts, number of outputs, quantities, etc. Measurable goals are important because they leave little room for confusion around expectations from stakeholders. 

Not every metric will have value, so you will have to determine which metrics make sense for the project. For example, measuring how many meetings the software engineers on your project attend on a weekly basis may not be the most valuable metric for a productivity goal. Alternatively, you might measure other aspects of the engineers’ productivity, such as a particular number of features created per engineer or a specific number of issues flagged per day.    
    
### Defining a SMART goal

Let’s explore an example related to making a personal goal measurable. Imagine you are looking to make a career change, and you set a goal to complete a Google Career Certificate. You can measure the success of this goal because after completing the entire program, you will receive a certificate—a tangible outcome.

Now, let’s determine how to make the remaining elements of this goal SMART. In this example, your specific goal is to attain a Google Career Certificate. You can make this goal attainable by deciding that you will complete one course per month. This goal is relevant because it supports your desire to make a career change. Finally, you can make this goal time-bound by deciding that you will complete the program within six months.

After defining each of these components, your SMART goal then becomes: Obtain a Google Career Certificate by 

### Key takeaway

Determining metrics can be extremely helpful in capturing statuses, successes, delays, and more in a project. As a project manager, identifying meaningful metrics can help move the project toward its goal. Additionally, by defining each element of a project goal to make it SMART, you can determine what success means for that goal and how to achieve it.

### Determining a project's scope
 
     Simply put project and its boundary
     Scope makes sure that your project is clearly defined and mapped out, who is using the nd result, its complexicity
     Is it easily manageable in subtasks?
     Scope also define project timeline, budget and resources
     
     Additional questions with project scope
        * where did the projec come from?
        * why is it needed?
        * why is the project expected to achieve?
        * what does the project sponsor have in mind?
      

### Asking scope-defining questions
Imagine that while working in a restaurant management group, your manager calls and asks you to “update the dining space,” then quickly hangs up the phone without providing further instruction. In this initial handoff from the manager, you are missing a lot of information. How do you even know what to ask?

Let’s quickly recap the concept of scope. The scope provides the boundaries for your project. You define the scope to help identify necessary resources, resource costs, and a schedule for the project. 

In the situation we just described, here are some questions you might ask your manager in order to get the information you need to define the scope of the project:

### Monitoring and maintaining a project's scope
__In-scope & out-of-scope__

    In-scope: tasks that are included in the project plan and contribute to the project's goal
    Out-of-scope: tasks that are not included
    
    Scope creep: any changes, growth, idea, and uncontrolled factors that affect the project's scope at any point after the project begin.
